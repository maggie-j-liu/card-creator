## The Project

Card Creator is a platform where people can create and share digital holiday cards with anyone anywhere in the world!

### Supabase

We used Supabase for authentication and store profile information so that users can go back and edit any cards they created. We also used the Supabase database to store data for the messages on the cards as well as the cards themselves.

### Future

As busy high school students, we were not able to finish the project before the deadline due to final exams and school activities. However, some features we would have liked to implement in our project are \***\*\_\_\*\***.

## Develop

First, install dependencies:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Add environment variables:

in `.env.local`

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
