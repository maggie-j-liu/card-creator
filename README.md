## The Project

Card Creator is a platform where people can create and share digital holiday cards with anyone anywhere in the world! Every holiday season, the postal service becomes inundated with mail that there are [holiday shipping delays](https://www.cleveland.com/news/2021/11/us-postal-service-recommends-sending-packages-early-this-holiday-season.html) across the continent. To send holiday greetings to friends and family more reliably, people can use Card Creator!

1. Create a card:

2. Add messages:

3. Share!

### Supabase

We used Supabase for authentication and store profile information so that users can go back and edit any cards they created. We also used the Supabase database to store data for the messages on the cards as well as the cards themselves.

### Future

As busy high school students, we were not able to finish the project before the deadline due to final exams and school activities. However, some features we would have liked to implement in our project are allowing the avatars on the card to be draggable, providing customization options for the font, color and patterns on the card and creating options for keeping the card private or publicly accessible. Additionally, mobile responsiveness has not been at the top of our list while creating the website; even so we would have liked to implement it as well.

## Develop

First, install dependencies:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Add environment variables:

in `.env.local`

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
